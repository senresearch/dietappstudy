# Assessing the contribution of self-monitoring through a commercial weight loss app: mediation and predictive modeling
---

## Abstract
Consistent dietary and physical activity self-monitoring is an essential component of successful weight loss in traditional in-person behavioral weight loss programs and technology-based programs. Commercial technology-based dietary and physical activity monitoring programs have grown in quantity and popularity with applications like Lose It!<sup>TM</sup> and MyFitnessPal<sup>TM</sup>. 
Our objective was to investigate the effects of electronic self-monitoring behavior (using the commercial Lose It!<sup>TM</sup> application) and weight-loss interventions (with differing amounts of counselor feedback and support) on 4 and 12-month weight loss.
 In this secondary analysis of the Fit Blue study, adapted from the Look AHEAD Intensive Lifestyle Intervention for a military lifestyle, we compared the results from two interventions of a randomized controlled trial. Counselor-initiated (CI) treatment participants received early, consistent support from interventionists, and self-paced (SP) treatment participants received assistance on request. Participants (n= 191) who were active-duty military personnel were encouraged to self-monitor diet and exercise with the Lose It!TM application or website. We examined logging trends throughout the study for associations between intervention assignment and app usage. We conducted a mediation analysis of the intervention assignment on weight loss through multiple mediators: app usage, number of self-weighing, and 4-month weight change. We used linear regression to predict weight loss at 4 and 12 months, and we measured the model's accuracy using cross-validation.
We found that app usage and daily reported caloric intake substantially impact weight loss prediction at 4 months. Our analysis did not find evidence of an association between participant self-monitoring exercise information and weight loss. Since the mediation analysis showed that 4-month weight loss completely mediated 12-month weight loss, intervention targets should promote early and frequent dietary intake self-monitoring and self-weighing to target early weight loss goals leading to long-term success.
